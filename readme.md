# Offline Schedule

Super quick site for Day 2 of FITC Web Unleashed. 

Inspired also in part by Lea Verou's tweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wish conferences realized that nobody reads printed schedules. It would save so many trees and would enable last minute schedule changes.</p>&mdash; Lea Verou (@LeaVerou) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/782722507375833089">October 2, 2016</a></blockquote>

Uses Service Workers to cache the content so you can get at it offline when the conference WIFI is down or super slow. As it always seems to be the case at conferences!! ❤️
